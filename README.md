# Projet-3---Portfolio-architecte-sophie-bluel

/**********
  CONTEXT
**********/

In this bootcamp project, my task was to develop a functionnal front-end for an interior architect's website.
Starting from a a skeleton mark-up, I had to develop the following:
 * the presentation page of the architect's work (from the provided HTML )
 * a login page for the site administrator (the client) (code to be created from scratch)
 * the modals allowing to edit and upload new media (code to be created from scratch)

This project taught me how to:
* use API documentation and build fetch requests
* use Javascript to dynamically render data and manipulate the DOM
* use a Powershell terminal, node.js and npm

Note: Of all the "modify" buttons, only the main Portfolio "modify" button is functionnal, as per specs. Similarly, the Contact Form is not functionnal either.
